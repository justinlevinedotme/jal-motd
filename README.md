# jal-motd
 A Dynamic and highly MOTD, heavily based off of raspberrypi-motd by ar51an. Without his work, this wouldn't be possible. 

 Going into my continuation of this, I wanted to include things that added ease of installation, and further configuration. I'm not super good with this, so it really is my first attempt at something useful.
